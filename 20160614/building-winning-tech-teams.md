#Fail Wall
![inline fill 200%](fail-wall.jpg)

^ One of the ideas I tried in the past is to have a fail wall where the team can state what features and projects went completely south and what did we learn with those experiences. I think ackowledging the fact that we are always learning and that we do mistakes unites the team members and creates a team spirit.

# Team Structure
## Feels like a "mini startup"
## Self Organizing
## Takes ownership

^
The perfect team for me has all elements necessary to ship a quality product. 
The PM, PO and designer should work closely with the team.
